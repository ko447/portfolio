        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Kolawole Ogunniyi, a passionate Computer Science major with a Mathematics minor at Towson University. I’m eager to make an impact in the tech world, blending my love for problem-solving with a deep interest in software development. I’ve gained hands-on experience working with languages like Python, Java, and C++, as well as diving into databases and Linux environments.
In high school, I interned at Open Professional Group, where I contributed to quality assurance and managed databases. I also had the privilege of being part of academic clubs like the Academic Challenge Club, which fueled my competitive spirit and honed my ability to think quickly under pressure.
When I’m not coding, I’m often learning new skills, whether it's exploring Discrete Mathematics, taking on new projects in WordPress, or learning HTML/CSS to expand my web development abilities. Outside of tech, I’ve been involved in youth soccer as a coach mentor and enjoy staying fit with a healthy meal plan and active lifestyle.
I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow, whether through internships, personal projects, or engaging in the latest tech challenges. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Project 1 (Misinformation Detection Tool): Tackling misinformation with a browser extension or tool that analyzes credibility is an innovative way to combat the spread of fake news in real time. It's both timely and useful.</li>
            <li>Project 2 (Urban Traffic Optimization System): While traffic apps exist, building a system that optimizes not just for drivers but also for public transport users, and integrates with real-time city data, would be an advanced and unique offering.</li>
        </ul>
